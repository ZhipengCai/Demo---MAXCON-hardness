# Demo---Robust Fitting in Computer Vision: Easy or Hard?

Originally published in ECCV 2018 as **oral** presentations, extended to the **IJCV special issue for the 12 best papers of ECCV 2018**.

The code used in the experiment of the IJCV version, **currently only for reviews, please do not copy or distribute for any other purpose**. 

------------------------
Instructions
------------------------

1. For calculating the FPT bound, run the 'numberOfBasis/computeNOBasis.m' file.

2. For executing the experiments for kernelization, run the 'kernelization/kernelization.m' file. Since the dataset used in the paper is quite large, we do not provide it along with the code, please download the data first and run the code later.
